## Sequential Bayesian Inference for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems

A Sequential Bayesian Inference tutorial for the solution of **state**, **state-parameter** and **input-state-parameter** estimation problems in uncertain nonlinear dynamic systems on the basis of sparse measurements.

### Algorithms

- Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
- Particle Filter (PF)
- Particle Filter with Mutation (MPF)
- Sigma-Point Particle Filter (SPPF)
- Gaussian-Mixture Sigma-Point Particle Filter (GMSPPF)
- Rao-Blackwelised Particle Filter (RBPF)
- Dual Kalman Filter - Unscented Kalman Filter (DKF-UKF)
